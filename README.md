# Hydraulic model to understand the reduction of losses in hydraulic systems. 

The idea behind this project is to develop a standard hydraulic model to demonstrate the effects of pressure management and the different models of damage location in aqueduct networks.

for this we will use EPANET with R and the packages "epanetReader" and "epanet2toolkit".

## Development of a standard network.

## Calculation of the effect of different pressure management models.

### One Inlet

#### Inlet mit constant pressure.
#### Inlet with Time-based pressure modulation
#### Inlet with controlled pressure according to the flow __p_i=f(q_t)__.
#### tank effect

### Multi inlet
