# Hydraulic model to understand the reduction of losses in hydraulic systems. 

The idea behind this project is to develop a standard hydraulic model to demonstrate the effects of pressure management and the different models of damage location in aqueduct networks.

for this we will use EPANET with R and the packages "epanetReader" and "epanet2toolkit".

## Development of a standard network.

First, we need to create a fictional Hydraulic modelling network sector with measured inputs and for pressure reducing valve controller.

We will define an area measured by the district (DMA, for its acronym in English) fictitious to check the different strategies of pressure management in order to reduce the actual water losses.

Effective measurement / calculation will help to quantify un-generated water and reduce waste.

### Development of a standard network 100m * 100m 

## Pressure Management

Calculation of the effect of different pressure management models.

Pressure management can be defined as the practice of managing system pressures to the optimum levels of service while ensuring sufficient and efficient supply to legitimate uses.The positive effects of pressure management are to decrease real water losses by reducing unnecessary or excess pressures.

### One Inlet systems

 - Inlet mit constant pressure.
 - Inlet with Time-based pressure modulation
 - Inlet with controlled pressure according to the flow __p_i=f(q_t)__.
 - Tank effect

### Multi inlet


## Comparison of different sensor placement algorithms for model-based leak localization.
